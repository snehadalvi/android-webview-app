<h3>WebCapsule for Android Apps</h3>
<p>This app is developed to test the record and replay functionality of WebCapsule for Android Web Apps.
Android Web Apps use WebView to display web pages. We have build System WebView with embedded WebCapsule component. 
So, we will be able to record and replay browsing traces in Android Apps.</p>
<br>

<h3>WebCapsule</h3>
<p>WebCapsule is a Record & Replay engine for Web Browsers implemented 
as a self-contained instrumentation of Blink/V8. WebCapsule allows for 
recording and replaying browsing traces, and primarily aims to enable the 
reconstruction and forensic analysis of web security incidents such as social 
engineering and phishing attacks.</p>

<p>WebCapsule is implemented as a self-contained instrumentation
layer around Google’s Blink web rendering engine, which is already embedded 
in a variety of browsers (e.g., Chrome, WebView, Opera, Amazon Silk, etc.) 
and can run on different platforms (e.g., Linux, Android, Windows, and Mac OS).</p>
