# android-webview-app

This Android app will open a given web URL in webview inside the app.

Android Web Apps use WebView to display web pages. We have built System WebView with embedded WebCapsule component. 
Using this app, we can test record and replay functionality of WebCapsule.

WebCapsule Project
WebCapsule is a Record & Replay engine for Web Browsers implemented as a self-contained instrumentation of Blink/V8. WebCapsule allows for 
recording and replaying browsing traces, and primarily aims to enable the reconstruction and forensic analysis of web security incidents such as social 
engineering and phishing attacks.
